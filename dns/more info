Changing password and keys
Change all user passwords
Change keys on the system
Only ones should be the ones that you set up and the scoring engine keys
Scoring key should say scoring key don’t remove
Back up scoring keys
In the authorized keys file, there should only be the scoring engine key, anything else is a redteam key
Don’t use default keys as blueteam, make your own
Close reverse shell
sudo lsof -i - or use netstat
Bind shells are easy to track because they’re constantly running
Reverse shells are only easy to detect if they’re actively being used
ps aux PID - see what’s going on
Look through the command and see where it’s being run from
Emacs
Wordle
PAM
Usually where password loggers are
Look at the files and see if they were edited recently
ls -l or ll
Things that are usually messed with
passwordauth
systemauth
Make sure no weird scripts are running
System users

Remove unneeded users
Reduce unneeded services
Change passwords/keys

Lock the root user
Should be either a !! or * in between the first two colons
Should NOT be nothing, that means no password
If there's also a bin bash shell for the user, take away the shell and set a password
Do it from the command line
If you’re unsure, lock the account rather than deleting the user
sudo passwd -l account
Locking the account means you can’t switch to be that user

Check the shadow and passwd files

Delete all obvious redteam users, then go through system users
THEN change passwords 


alias and unalias
Which command to find which binary the command is using
The binaries can be moved and renamed, even though they might keep the binary
Debsums
Run a command to check all the bin files
rpm -Va

Aliases
You can switch your shell to get rid of bash aliases
Just type in sh
Aliases are related to the shell you’re in
Different users can have different alias
/etc/bashrc
/home/user/.bashrc holds your aliases
Delete malicious lines
Source the file
source ~/.bashrc
Reloads the service but for bash


Shells are usually bash sh zsh

Bashrc runs when you log in

Look at what runs when you log in
Message of the day

Most system processes are not a bash script

rsyslog is the logger. Make sure its on and active
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service

ps aux | grep bash

Check the groups file to see what users are in which groups
blackteam and blueteam should be in wheel and that’s pretty much it
sudo visudo - if there are ANY syntax errors, everything will break
Sudo should have access to all
Wheel should have access to all but should require a password
Leave blackteam alone…
