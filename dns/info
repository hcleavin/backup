Getting DNS to work:
Zone files must be valid and correct
named-checkzone zonename filename
named-checkconf -z - checks named.conf and test loads all master zones
Zone files must be listed in the appropriate file
Depends on what file. Just make sure the file path is correct
Permissions
root bind 644 - configuration files
root root 644 - db.files
root bind drwxr-s-r-x - zones directory
For external, port forwarding on the router to the DNS server

Hardening:
Update everything
Named.conf file
Options 
Enable DNSSEC
ACL
Disable zone transfers
Rate limiting
Disable recursion
version "DNSDNSDNSDNSDNSDNSDNSDNSDNSDNSDNSDNS";
Logging
print-time yes;
print-category yes;
print-severity yes;
Backups

Troubleshooting
Check connection with other devices on the network

Starting up
Where are files usually located?
find / -type t -name ‘named.conf’
The directory with all the files will be listed in the options block
What ports must be open/allowed?
Daemons?
The named daemon is the only daemon required for basic functionality
IP addresses listening? - all or just one?

To work:
What is the minimum requirement for it to work?
What files are required for it to be up?
What formatting does work?
What permissions are required?
What ownership is required?
What formatting doesn’t work?/What makes it not work?

Hardening:
What options make it more secure?
What ways can an attacker stop it from working?
What parts of the server are vulnerable?

Troubleshooting:
What should be listening?/What is listening?
What ports should be open?/What ports are open?
What parts of the server might be targeted?


Daemons for bind

Reverse lookup zone files are sensitive to the final dot
Check if resolv.conf file has your computer set as its nameserver
You can make files immutable…
Recursion should be no, this is an authoritative nameserver
Run bind as an unprivileged user
Response rate limiting

Conditions to monitor include:
process presence
CPU utilization
memory usage
network throughput and buffering (inbound/outbound)
filesystem utilization (on the log filesystem and also the filesystem containing the named working directory)
Logs should be examined periodically for error and warning messages which may provide a tip-off for incipient problems before they become critical.
